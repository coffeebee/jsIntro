Write a program that shows all numbers between 1 and 100 
with the following exceptions:

-It shows "Fizz" instead if the number is divisible by 3.
-It shows "Buzz" instead if the number is divisible by 5 
    and not by 3.
-When it's done, improve it so that the program shows 
    "FizzBuzz" instead for numbers divisible both by 3 
    and by 5.

This exercise has many, many solutions It's a job 
interview classic that a significant number of candidates 
fail. Try your best!
